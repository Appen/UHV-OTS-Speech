### Transcription Rules and Tips
| Category | Audio Clip | Correct Transcription |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| **Self-correction•** When the user self-corrects, transcribe everything the user says	Will would you open spotify	will would you open spotify |
| **Numerals•** Words or phrases should be the spelled-out version	891 oh 2 |	eighty nine one o two |
| **Time and Date Phrases•** Words or phrases should be transcribed as the user says |	7:00 1/2/2019	| seven o’clock january second twenty nineteen (or january second two thousand nineteen based on the audio |
| **Contractions•** When encountering contractions, do not split the contraction into two words. We should be transcribeing exactly what we hear	| i'm gonna leave i'm going to leave	| i'm gonna leave i'm going to leave |
| **Acronyms•** Acronyms that are pronounced as an actual word instead of as a sequence of letters will be transcribed as one word |	NASA SCUBA |	nasa scuba |


**Pronunciation**

  - Speakers often pronounce his as “he’s”. This is just the accent, so it should still be transcribed as his
  - People will often say **they gone** when speakers of other dialects might say “they’ve gone” or “they left”. Transcribe the words exactly as they are spoken
  - **we'll** and **will** may sound closer to each other than in other accents you’re used to. Make sure you are using the correct one
  - **that’s** may sound more like “thass” or “dass”. Be sure to still transcribe it as **that’s**
  - **address** can sound a bit like “edges”. Be sure to spell it **address** in that case
  - **phone** can sound like “fuh-wan” or “fowan”. Be sure not to accidentally transcribe it as a word like “following”

**Grammar**
  - Be mindful of the difference between your (possession) and you’re (you are)
  - Be mindful of the difference between its (possession) and it’s (contraction of “it is”) and be sure you are using the right one
  - Please spell okay rather than “ok”
  - Keep in mind the difference between their (possession) and they’re (contraction of “they are”) and make sure you are using the right one
  - Bear in mind the difference between suites and sweets, which are pronounced the same. If the person is talking about a hotel or other location, the correct spelling will most likely be suites
  - If a speaker says something like “buh-bye” please transcribe it as bye bye
